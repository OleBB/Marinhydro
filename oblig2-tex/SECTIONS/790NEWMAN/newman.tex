- solve problem 6.17 in newman for the 2d case obtaining approzimations of the exciting force and damping force. compare the approxiamte solution to the full calculation of b22

hint: in the calculation of the exciting force in prob 6.17 use of the froud-Krylov approximation is made, obtaining, in the 2d case, 


\begin{equation}
	X_2^{FK} = - \mathrm{i} \omega \rho \int_{S_B} \phi_0 n_2 dS =\rho g \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} e^{-KD- \mathrm{i}KX} dx = \rho g L e^{-KD} \frac{\sin(KL/2)}{KL/2} 
\end{equation}
